        <h3 id="tip1">1. Get closer to nature</h3>
        <p>We have been living around other animals and plants for thousands of years. Some people say nature helps them
            feel calmer, more hopeful and less alone. Our research found that going for a walk was UK adults’ favourite
            way of coping with stress
            during the pandemic in 2020.

            In Japan, some people do “forest bathing”, which may improve their mental health. So going to a forest or
            wood and experiencing the different smells, sounds and textures may really help.

            To get the best out of nature’s healing effects, try tuning your senses to what’s around you – the trees,
            plants, birds and animals, for instance, and water such as ponds or the seashore.

            Take a deep breath and see how you feel. The idea is to get connected with your natural surroundings.</p>

        <h3 id="tip2">2. Get more from your sleep.</h3>
        <p>Anyone who has struggled with sleep will know what a difference it makes to our bodies, minds and ability to
            cope with life.

            We all have times when we sleep badly, and some of us live in situations that make a good night’s sleep
            impossible.

            For many people, sleep is often the first thing that suffers when we're struggling with our mental health.

            Adults need between 7 and 9 hours' sleep a night, including enough dreaming sleep and enough deeper sleep.

            If you’re struggling with your sleep, think about trying a few simple changes.

            For example:
        <ul>
            <li>Develop a relaxing bedtime routine to help you start winding down before you actually go to sleep
            </li>
            <li>Avoid TV and mobile screens, alcohol and caffeine before bed. This will help you fall asleep and stay
                asleep. You could also avoid vigorous exercise before bed.
            </li>
            <li>Go to bed and get up at around the same time every day, including weekends.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 id="tip3">3. Keep moving</h3>
        <p>Our bodies and minds are connected, so looking after ourselves physically also helps us prevent problems with
            our mental health (it works the other way around, too).

            Moving our bodies – with sport, gardening, dancing, cycling, walking the dog, cleaning or going to the gym,
            for example – are great ways to improve our mental and physical health.

            Exercise releases “feel good” hormones that reduce feelings of stress and anger. It also helps us feel
            better about our bodies. It can improve our sleep too. If it involves other people, like being part of a
            team, a class or a group we see regularly, that can also boost our mental health.

            We don’t have to be professional athletes, or sporty, to get the benefits of being physically active. From
            walking to dancing and basketball to the gym, the best exercise is simply the one we enjoy.

        </p>

        <h3 id="tip4">4. Eat healthy food</h3>
        <p>Food and drink affect our bodies, brains and mood – for good or bad.

            Sugary snacks and drinks can give us a temporary “high” or sense of comfort that can feel irresistible. But
            they soon leave us feeling exhausted or jittery. Caffeine in coffee, tea, or so-called energy drinks can
            also have this effect.

            A balanced diet with lots of vegetables and fruit is essential for good physical and mental health.

            How we eat is also important. Having meals with other people can help to grow relationships – with family,
            friends, partners, and colleagues. This is really important in protecting everyone’s mental health and
            preventing problems.

            Food can also get mixed up with our feelings. Some people over-eat or under-eat when they are upset. It may
            help to talk to someone we trust and get professional support if we need it.

        <h3 id="tip5">5. Be kind and help create a better world</h3>
        <p>If you have ever felt lonely, you will know how much it helps to have even a small connection with someone
            else.

            Exchanging a smile or friendly words can be comforting and lift our mood.

            Research shows that being kind is good for both sides. Being kind can boost our mood, help us feel more
            capable, strengthen our connections with others and even make us cope better with stress.

            If you don’t know where to start, you could try small but meaningful acts of kindness, such as offering a
            smile or a few kind words to another person. You could make their day but also feel better for it - friendly
            connections with others are vital for our mental health.

            We can also help others by doing volunteer work and getting together with other people to work for good
            causes.

            These things can help us feel connected with others and the world around us. It can give us the sense that
            we can make a difference. All of this is good for our mental health.

        </p>

        <h3 id="tip6">6. Be curious and open-minded to new experiences</h3>
        <p>We can all get stuck in familiar ways, like how we spend our time and what we think about ourselves and the world.

            This can be self-fulfilling, with our expectations influencing what actually happens, for good or bad. For example, we might say to ourselves: “Things never get better” or “I’m useless” as a response to what others have said to us.
            
            It can help to notice these thoughts and try out new ones, such as “I can change things for the better” and “there is so much I can do”.
            
            Life can feel more interesting, lively and rewarding when we are open to trying new experiences and experimenting with how we do things.
            
            It could be as simple as what we have for breakfast or the route we walk with the dog. It could also need some planning, like an adventure holiday. We might find a new place that it turns out we love, discover a talent we didn’t know we had or meet someone new and important.</p>

        <h3 id="tip7">7. Plan things to look forward to</h3>
        <p>Life throws all sorts at us, and during hard times, we may feel hopeless and not have the energy to plan for the future.

            Things to look forward to, including fun activities, can help us cope with difficult situations.
            
            Making plans for things we enjoy can increase our sense of hope, which is important for our mental health. Our plan could be for anything from small pleasures, like a cup of tea or your favourite TV programme or dance class, to a trip with family or friends, or seeing your favourite film, sports team or singer.
            
            Whether it’s a small or a big one, the important thing is to plan it.
            
            Decide what you’ll do, when and with who and, if needed, book it. It’s important to follow your plan – and repeat.</p>

        <h3 id="tip8">8.  Learn to understand and manage your feelings</h3>
        <p>Feeling very upset can interfere with our lives, making it hard to think clearly or work, relax, study, sleep or deal with other people.

            Many of us will know when we’re upset but not be sure what we’re feeling. Is it sadness, fear, shame, loneliness, anger or something else? We don’t always know why we’re feeling that way.
            
            It often helps to give our feelings our attention without judging them, without telling ourselves we’re stupid or weak to feel the way we do. It may seem strange and uncomfortable to do this. But practice and patience with ourselves will help.
            
            Naming what we’re feeling is also likely to help. So, we can say to ourselves: “I’m feeling really irritable today but also sad.” Another helpful step can be to work out what has led to us feeling this way – might it be a disagreement or disappointment that you’ve had? Some women might find that their periods sometimes (or always) affect their moods.
            
            Talking kindly to ourselves, in the same way, we might reassure a small child we care about, is also important. It can be very comforting. You might feel uncomfortable initially, but give it a go – it might just help.
            
            Some people feel better if they write down their feelings in a notebook or on their phone. You might want to think about how to protect your privacy before doing this.
            
            You could try repeating something positive about yourself a few times each day. (This is sometimes called a “mantra”. “I am on a journey, growing and developing”, for example.) Research shows this reduces negative thoughts and feelings.
            
            Some people also feel that an activity called “mindfulness” is helpful. Talking with someone else can also be helpful – and that’s our next suggestion…
            
            </p>

        <h3 id="tip9">9. Talk to someone you trust for support</h3>
        <p>Many of us have learned to bottle things up inside us and try to ignore painful feelings. It can take a lot of courage to tell someone else how we’re feeling or what we’re finding hard, especially if we don’t usually do that kind of thing.

            Just talking things through with a person we trust can help and feel like a relief.
            
            Use your own words. It’ll make you feel safer and less alone, and that will help protect your mental health and prevent problems.
            
            Talking may also change how you see and feel about the situation in ways you find helpful.
            
            Another possible benefit is that talking may strengthen your relationship with the person you speak with. This will benefit both of you and make it easier for them to turn to you when they need support themselves.
            
            </p>

        <h3 id="tip10">10. Be aware of using drugs and/or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings</h3>
        <p>Many of us sometimes use drugs to block out “difficult” feelings such as sadness, fear or shame.

            No one wants to feel bad; for some people, drugs and/or alcohol offer temporary relief.
            
            Unfortunately, they don’t stop the feelings from returning and may make things worse or create other problems, including damage to mental and physical health, relationships, work, or study.
            
            If you think you may be using drugs or alcohol to cope with difficult feelings, it may help to notice it without beating yourself up about it. Being understanding and kind to yourself is good for your mental health.
            
            A possible next step could be to talk with someone you trust or one of the charities that offer confidential, free information and advice, including how to reduce the harmfulness of using drugs. Have a look at Talk To Frank, for example.
            
            You could also look for other ways of coping with painful feelings, such as getting help with the situation causing them, if possible, and finding a trusted person to talk with. This could be a friend or relative, a colleague, a person working for a charity helpline, your GP or a counsellor.
            
            Many charities around the country offer low-cost or free therapy. Find more detailed information about getting help with your mental health from many potential sources.
            
            Some people find it helps to go to “anonymous” meetings, such as Narcotics Anonymous, to share with others who have/had similar experiences. Some of these meetings are also now online.</p>
